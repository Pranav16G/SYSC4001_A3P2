Mutual exclusion -> Only one TA can access the rubric at a time.
                    Semaphore locks are used during rubric modification restricting the other TA from manipulating the rubric.txt

Bounded waiting -> This code uses a code structure to that of the reader writer problem, hence prevents the reader or writer from startvation
                   or not having the oppurtunity to write onto the common shared space file.

Progress -> Similar to reader writer, if there is no new process in critical section a process is allowed to 
            to enter. In this way there is no TA left without any question to grade, and there is no clash between 
            2/ more TA trying to modify the same file, achieved by using semophore locks which are released once the 
            desired work is done.
